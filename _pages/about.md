I am a data scientist at [Airbnb](http://www.airbnb.com) and an Adjunct Assistant Professor at the [University of Chicago Booth School of Business](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/c/thomas-covert).  I was previously the Scientific Director of the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu)'s [Energy and Environment Lab](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/labs/energy-environment), and an affiliate of [EPIC](http://epic.uchicago.edu), where I studied industrial organization and energy economics.
